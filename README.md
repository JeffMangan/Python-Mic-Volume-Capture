Code to monitor loudness
* It captures the mic input and determines the input volume level, and displays as a bar chart, for example to monitor the noise level in the room.
* This was a simple poc to capture how the level of noise coming from a room
*  The next step is to completely rewrite the code into an actual clean app.
