# Python-Dabase-Examples
code to interact with a postgres db.
This code was created in 2020 but was not uploaded to github until now.
It captures the mic input and determines the input volume level, and displays as a bar chart, for example to monitor the noise level in the room.
This was a side project created as a POC so sloppy code, WIP.
