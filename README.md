# Python-Mic-Volume-Capture

Code to monitor loudness.
* It captures the mic input, determines the input volume level, and displays it as a colored bar chart. This can be used to monitor the noise level in a room.
* This was a simple proof of concept (PoC) to capture how much noise is coming from a room.

**Note:**
--------
* Running this in the built-in terminal (e.g., PyCharm) will not produce the colored bar chart.
* This has only been tested on Ubuntu Linux.

## Installation
========================================

The following dependencies need to be installed:

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `sudo apt-get install libportaudio2 libportaudiocpp0 portaudio19-dev`

## Project Structure

- audio_processor.py   # Handles audio processing and volume calculations
- color_manager.py     # Manages color logic and printing of colored lines
- config.py            # Contains configuration constants and settings
- visualizer.py        # Combines audio processing and color management to visualize audio input
- main.py              # The entry point of the application
- __init__.py          # Marks the directory as a Python package

## Some additional features that I will more than likely never get to

### Bandwidth Throttling
**Feature**: Dynamically adjust the internet bandwidth of devices such as gaming consoles or computers based on detected noise levels. Excessive noise can lead to reduced internet speed, affecting online gaming and streaming.

**Implementation**: This feature would require integration with your smart home router via its API to manage bandwidth settings. A separate service could be developed to facilitate communication between the noise monitoring system and the router.

### IoT Annoying Alarm
**Feature**: Activate a loud and annoying alarm when noise exceeds a predetermined threshold, serving as a noise deterrent.

**Implementation**: Utilize an IoT platform like Arduino or Raspberry Pi equipped with a loud siren or buzzer that can be remotely activated from the main application over Wi-Fi.

### Lights and Visual Cues
**Feature**: Utilize smart lights to provide visual feedback on noise levelsâ€”red for too loud, yellow for caution, and green for acceptable levels.

**Implementation**: Connect to smart home systems such as Philips Hue or other Wi-Fi-enabled lighting solutions to adjust the lights based on the noise level.

### Silence Rewards System
**Feature**: Implement a system where children can earn points for maintaining low noise levels during designated hours. Points could be exchanged for privileges like extra internet time or other rewards.

**Implementation**: Develop a mobile app or a web-based dashboard where both parents and children can track points and rewards. Points are accrued by maintaining lower noise levels, logged and calculated through a simple database system.

### Smart TV Integration
**Feature**: Automatically adjust the volume or pause a TV or game console if the surrounding noise exceeds a certain level.

**Implementation**: This feature requires integration with smart TVs or media centers either through infrared signals or network commands, depending on device compatibility.

### Voice Alerts
**Feature**: Use a text-to-speech system to issue verbal warnings through smart speakers when the noise level is too high.

**Implementation**: Use existing smart speakers connected to your network to deliver pre-set verbal messages when high noise levels are detected.

### Privacy Considerations
Probably want to make sure your household knows your running this stuff !!
